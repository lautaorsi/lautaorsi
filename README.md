## 💡 About Me

I'm a developer who believes that **quality code** isn't just about functionality — it's about **readability, maintainability**, and **responsibility**.
I believe Computer Science is much more than just fast coding or "hacking" your way though answers, but rather a science that requires extensive understanding of the foundations of not only a computer internal structure but also how to properly communicate and understand the real life needs and 1:1 correlation with how we model thigs in the software industry. 

### What I Value:
- 🧠 **Proper Coding Techniques**  
  Writing clean, efficient, and scalable code with an emphasis on clarity and best practices.
  
- 📚 **Good Documentation**  
  A proper code needs no documentation, as the code becomes the documentation.
  
- 💬 **Social skills**  
  Computer science has long been deemed as the science that requires no social skills but I firmly believe that is what causes the most damage to the industry. 
  It is imperative that we strengthen our social bonds and master the art of clear and efficient communication to ensure a smooth transition between the technical and non-technical aspects of our field.

## 🚀 Current Focus

I have recently taken an interest in cybersecurity and it's relation with databases. I also want to keep doing small side projects with different languages so as to keep a more generalized approach to problem solving.
